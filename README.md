Personalized collection of the most important content learned in pre-work.   This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and Javascript. 

The goal for this project was to prepare the basic knowledge about Web Development before starting the bootcamp. 
I wanted to be ready to apply the concepts right away at class withouut taking time to understand the concepts. 
Now I will be able to check my notes whenever i struggle with understanding any concept about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

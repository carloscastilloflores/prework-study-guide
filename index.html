          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents.</li>
          <li>CSS allows web developers to separate the content of a web page (defined with HTML) from its visual design and layout.</li>
          <li>CSS works by defining rules that apply styles to HTML elements, such as font sizes, colors, backgrounds, positioning, and other visual properties.</li>

          <li>It can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user input, and perform complex computations and animations.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
